# Hi, I'm Titan!
I develop software both as a professional, and as a freelance dev. I'm primarily a front-end developer, but I have experience as a full stack developer.

# Some of my favorite projects?
I think my favorite project I've done on this Github is probably Kirbo-Bot. Its a discord bot I made for me and friends to play around with in our discord.
Speaking of, If you wanna join my discord server, here's the link: [Army Gang](https://discord.gg/Muaepz4u9G)

I think my other favorite project is Baller. It's my first ever mobile game I made, using Unity and C#. Its really cool, and at it's peak, it had 50 users. It also has a crap ton of features I put into it. [Baller on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.PentagonGames.Baller)
