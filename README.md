# Some of my favorite projects?
I think my favorite project I've worked on is Agito, which was a dungeons and dragons character sheet made with Flutter and Dart.
Similar to that, I made a mod manager for Bonelab in Flutter.

I also have developed an entire trading card store for the web, to sell off all my excess Tim Hortons trading cards.

I think my other favorite project is Baller. It's my first ever mobile game I made, using Unity and C#. Its really cool, and at it's peak, it had 50 users. It also has a crap ton of features I put into it. [Baller on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.PentagonGames.Baller)
