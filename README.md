# Some of my favorite projects?
I think my favorite project I've worked on is Agito, which was a dungeons and dragons character sheet made with Flutter and Dart.
Similar to that, I made a mod manager for Bonelab in Flutter.
I also created a multiplayer game inspired by No Man's Sky, and uses WebSockets to communicate with a server and multiple clients. (This was my final project for Computer Science)

I also have developed an entire trading card store for the web, to sell off all my excess Tim Hortons trading cards.

I think another really cool project is Baller. It's my first ever mobile game I made, using Unity and C#. Its really cool, and at it's peak, it had 50 users.
I'm thinking of making a Baller 2, thats possibly 3D, or just a better version of the original
