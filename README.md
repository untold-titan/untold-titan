### Hi there I'm Titan. 

I am a Software Developer Intern at Arcurve.
This github account has all of my development projects I have created/worked on. 

## Some of my favorite projects?
I think my favorite project I've done on this Github is probably Kirbo-Bot. Its a discord bot I made for me and friends to play around with in our discord.
Speaking of, If you wanna join my discord server, here's the link: [Army Gang](https://discord.gg/Muaepz4u9G)

## Things about me!
 - I'm from Canada. 
 - I'm currently learning/experimenting with RESTful Web APIs. (HOW HAVE I NEVER USED THESE BEFORE)
 - I'm currently working on Kirbo-Bot.
 - Ask me about anything, you can reach me in my discord server, (I'm Titan, the friendly neighbourhood admin)
