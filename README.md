# My Career
I've worked professionally as a software developer for about 2 years now, in a variety of different project and team sizes.

## The Highlights of my Career - So far...
Built a massive data connector that takes data from an FTP server, deserializes it, converts it into a bunch of HTTP requests, to send to an eCommerce platform. 
The entire project has surpassed 1000+ of lines of code now, and still isnt finished. I've been the Project Manager, Tech Lead, QA and Lead Developer on this project. (Did I mention I'm the only person working on this? üòã) 

# My Favorite Projects
I think my favorite project I've worked on is Agito, which was a dungeons and dragons character sheet made with Flutter and Dart.
Similar to that, I made a mod manager for Bonelab in Flutter.
I also created a multiplayer game inspired by No Man's Sky, and uses WebSockets to communicate with a server and multiple clients. (This was my final project for Computer Science)

Another project that I built is a Docker Status webpage that monitors my server's docker instance and allows me to manage the compose folders and nginx config, so that I can do everything from a web browser instead of having to remote in all the time.
Some future improvements I'd like to make is adding a notification service that will ping me in the case of something failing. 

I think another really cool project is Baller. It's my first ever mobile game I made, using Unity and C#. Its really cool, and at it's peak, it had 50 users.
I'm thinking of making a Baller 2, thats possibly 3D, or just a better version of the original.
Baller was on the Google Play store, up until the requirements changed, and Google delisted it.
