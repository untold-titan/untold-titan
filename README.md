### Hi there, I'm Titan. 

I am a Summer Student at Arcurve.

## Some of my favorite projects?
I think my favorite project I've done on this Github is probably Kirbo-Bot. Its a discord bot I made for me and friends to play around with in our discord.
Speaking of, If you wanna join my discord server, here's the link: [Army Gang](https://discord.gg/Muaepz4u9G)

I think my other favorite project is Baller. It's my first ever mobile game I made, using Unity and C#. Its really cool, and at it's peak, it had 50 users. It also has a crap ton of features I put into it

## My tech stack
I use a stack I created myself! It's called STFN (Pronounced stefan)!

### Whats in the stack?
 - Svelte - S
 - Tailwind - T
 - Firebase - F
 - Node.js - N

This stack is VERY minimal, and is basically just a framework for all my projects. Each project I make will have some variation of STFN, but it'll be the same at the core.

## Things about me!
 - I'm from Canada. 🍁
 - I'm currently working on Web development with Reactjs and Svelte. (I like Svelte better)
 - I'm also working on moving my custom backend that I created, (cataclysmAPI) and moving it to Firebase so I have less code to maintain
 - Ask me about anything, you can reach me in my discord server, [Army Gang](https://discord.gg/Muaepz4u9G) (I'm Titan, the friendly neighbourhood admin) 
 - If you don't have discord, you can also reach me at untoldtitan3k@gmail.com.
 - Pronous: He/Him
 - Fun fact, I love Marvel and Pokemon. My favorite superhero is Iron man, followed by Spider man. My favorite (non-mythic/legendary) pokemon is Sylveon, and Rayquaza.
